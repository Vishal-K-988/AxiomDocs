Project Overview   \n3.1 Background & Motivation  \nThe current whitebo ard integration in Jitsi is based on a fork of Excalidraw, which means it only \nallows for limited smart object sharing and enforces a strict memory overload limit. This setup \nworks for basic tasks, but as more users try to collaborate, these limitations be come a real \nbottleneck. It restricts the natural flow of creativity and can cause performance issues during \nintense collaborative sessions.  \n Enhancing the whiteboard is crucial for providing a richer and more versatile collaborative \nenvironment.

This upgrade will not only make it easier \nfor users to share ideas and work together, but it will also help Jitsi stand out as a mor e robust \nplatform for digital collaboration.  \n3.2 Objectives  \nThis proposal outlines several clear and measurable objectives to significantly enhance the \nwhiteboard experience. One of the primary goals is to implement file upload support. This \nfeature will allow users to upload and share files directly on the whiteboard, adding an extra \ndimension to the collaborative process and making it easier to exchange detailed information.  \nAnother important objective is to upgrade to Socket.IO 4.

By \nrefining how  packet sizes are managed, the project will reduce latency and enhance the overall \nresponsiveness of the whiteboard during real-time interactions .

The solution involves adding file upload support  so that users can \neasily share document s and images directly on the whiteboard. In addition, updating to \nSocket.IO 4 will improve the real -time performance and compatibility of the system, while \noptimizing WebSocket connections will ensure smoother communication during collaborative \nsessions.  \nIn terms of system architecture, I have created a possible diagram that clearly shows how file \nuploads ( Figure 1 ) will be handled and integrated with the whiteboard interface.

Communication and Collaboration Plan  \n6.1 Mentor Interaction  \nI plan to have  regular interactions with my mentors, Sa\u00fal Ibarra Corretg\u00e9 and Mihaela \nDumitru , to ensure I\u2019m on the right track throughout the project. I propose scheduling weekly \nmeetings \u2014either via video call or chat \u2014where I can provide  updates, discuss challenges, \nand get guidance on next steps.  Additionally, I will prepare short progress reports before \neach meeting to outline what has been accomplished and what remains to be done.  \nMy Schedule  \nI can dedicate working time of  approx 34 hrs per week ,  \nConstraints :  \n1.  I\u2019m having 2 days of college [Tuesday and Wednesday]  \n2. Gym Schedule : 6pm to 10pm IST  \n3. End Semester exam in between April -May  \n4.

This will allow me to both share my progress and gather \ninsights from other community members. I believe that open communication is essential, so I \nwill make sure to regularly update my work on GitHub and promptly respond to any queries or", "insights from other community members.

After every mentor meeting \nand commun ity interaction, I plan to carefully review the feedback I receive and implement \nnecessary changes in my work. I will use an iterative approach, continuously testing and refining \nmy code based on suggestions and any issues that come up.

Risk Management and Contingency Plan  \n7.1 Potential Risk  \nThere could be some potential risks as I can see:  \n \n \nChallenges during migration to the newer Excalidraw:  \n \n\u25cf The current whiteboard is based on an older fork of Excalidraw. Upgrading to a newer \nversion might introduce compatibility issues or cause certain features to \nmalfunction . \n \n\u25cf There is a possibility that t he updated version has different functionalities or \ndependencies , which could lead to significant code modifications and delays.  \n \n \n  \nIntegration issues with Socket.IO 4 and WebSocket optimizations:  \n \n\u25cf Upgrading to Socket.IO 4 could lead to  integration problem s if the new version handles \nconnections differently compared to previous versions.  \n \n\u25cf Optimizing WebSocket connections for smoother real -time collaboration may encounter", "connections differently compared to previous versions.  \n \n\u25cf Optimizing WebSocket connections for smoother real -time collaboration may encounter \ntechnical hurdles that impact performance  if not implemented carefully.  \n \nMemory overload concerns with new file upload features:  \n \n\u25cf Introducing file upload capabilities might lead to higher memory usage, especially if \nusers upload large files or multiple files simultaneously.  \n \n\u25cf Without proper management, this increased memory usag e could slow down the system \nor even result in crashes during peak usage.  \n \n \n \n7.1 Mitigation Strategies   \nNow to overcome these hurdles I have planned some strategies.  \nMaintain regular communication with mentors:  \n \n\u25cf Weekly meetings or progress reports with mentors Sa\u00fal Ibarra Corretg\u00e9 and Mihaela \nDumitru  to discuss challenges and seek guidance.  \n \n\u25cf Frequent check -ins can help us in early detection of issues, allowing for adjustments in \nthe project plan before problems es calate.", "Dumitru  to discuss challenges and seek guidance.  \n \n\u25cf Frequent check -ins can help us in early detection of issues, allowing for adjustments in \nthe project plan before problems es calate.  \n \nConduct thorough testing at each phase:  \n \n\u25cf Implementing  comprehensive unit tests and integration tests for every new feature and \nupdate, ensuring that each component works as expected.  \n \n\u25cf Perform performance and stress tests, especially for the new f ile upload feature, to \nidentify and resolve  potential memory overload  issues early on.  \n \n Incremental changes with rollback options:  \n \n\u25cf Develop and deploy updates in small, manageable increments rather than large, \nsweeping changes.
